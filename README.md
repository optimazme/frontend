## Summary ##

A token-gated timed Metaverse maze scavenger hunt. Each maze benefits a different charity and the images that are found come with words that can be redeemed for an AI generated image at the end of the game. 

Every purchase of a game token will enter the user into a raffle for an NFT, and each additional used game token and AI generated art will grant the user extra entries.
